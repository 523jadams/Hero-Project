    <h1>My hero is Spider-Man because of his amazing abilities and his job to protect others. He uses his powers for good and even as a regular person when he is not being Spider-Man, he is a good person to everyone. Without Spider-Man, New York City would be in a lot of danger and it is very inspirational that he uses his powers for good no matter what.
